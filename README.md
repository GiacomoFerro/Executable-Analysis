# Executable-Analysis-ggfm
An analysis of a program to verify its correctness
--------------------------------------------------
### How to run the code:

To shell:

1.  ./testGGFM: to save on the file named "outputGGFM.txt" the result of computation of GGFM with a time preload. This file will have to be analyzed.

2.  ./testCorretto: to save on the file named "outputCorretto.txt" the result of right computation with a time preload.

3.  ./analisiRisultati: to save on the file "confronto.txt" the wrong dates of GGFM. Then the program will save the match/mismatch dates on "matchDate.txt" and "misMatchDate.txt".
